# Adding color to multiple shapes.

In order to add a different colour to each of our shapes, we need to set the colour before we draw our shape on the screen.
As we know this is done with the function fill().
Thus, before we draw each shape we also call fill() with specific colour values to set the colour.

Example:
<div>
  <code><object data="Example.js" width="650" height="300"></object></code>
</div>
