# 1. Introduction to shapes.

## Creating your first shapes using the p5 processing library.

The library consist of some basic api calls which allows you to create basic shapes, such as rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, etc.
Following the reference https://p5js.org/reference/
The api library calls should be added to the draw() function in the p5 processing sketch after the background() function call.

Note: Remember instructions are executed in sequence one by one.
