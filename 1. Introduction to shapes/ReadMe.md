# 1. Introduction to shapes.

## Creating your first shapes using the p5 processing library.

The library consist of some basic API calls which allows you to create basic shapes, such as rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, etc.

These API calls can be found at the p5.js reference page: <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/" target="_blank">https://p5js.org/reference/</a>

The API library calls for drawing the shapes should be added inside the draw() function in the p5 processing sketch after the background() function call.

Note: Remember instructions are executed in sequence one by one.
