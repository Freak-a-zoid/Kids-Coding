# Drawing multiple shapes.

To draw multiple shapes we just need to make a function call for each shape that we would like to draw.

Example 1:
<div>
  <code><object data="Example-1.js" width="400" height="200"></object></code>
</div>

Shapes can be drawn on top of one another.

Example 2:
<div>
  <code><object data="Example-2.js" width="400" height="200"></object></code>
</div>

Thus, the order of what shape is drawn on top depends on the order of the function calls written in code.
