# Kids-Coding
Introduction to programming for kids using JavaScript.

## Introduction
This tutorial is for teaching children to learn programming at a young age. The aim is to allow children to understand programming concepts with direct visual feedback based on basic implementations. Allowing the child to directly see the changes they make in code for a more hands-on approach. Separating itself from traditional approaches, where children only select statements and not directly writting code.

Child will learn a professional popular programming language JavaScript.
