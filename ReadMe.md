## Introduction
This tutorial is for teaching children to learn programming at a young age. The aim is to allow children to understand programming concepts with direct visual feedback based on basic implementations. Allowing the child to directly see the changes they make in code for a more hands-on approach. Separating itself from traditional approaches, where children are only selecting statements and are not directly writing code.

Children will learn a professional popular programming language JavaScript.

## Requirements
- An internet connection.
- Access to the p5.js Web Editor. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org" target="_blank">https://editor.p5js.org/</a>

## Using the p5.js web editor
Code should be written by using the web editor.

The examples in this tutorial will contain both the initial code of the web editor and the added statements that should be added to make the examples work.

To add the code, go to the web editor (via the link above) and add the extra code statements show in the examples.

Run the code with the play button on the top left or enable the auto-refresh option in the editor to automatically run the code.
